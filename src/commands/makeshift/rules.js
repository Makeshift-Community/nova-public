				:white_small_square: Let the moderators know if you‚Äôd like to be absent for a longer period of time.
				:white_small_square: We consider 60 days to be our hard limit. Reaching this limit will almost surely result in a kick.
				:white_small_square: We might kick players below 14 days of inactivity if we suspect they‚Äôre just logging in for the sake of reserving their own spot without actually playing.
				:white_small_square: At any given time we might be condoning activity checks on our Discord server. We expect a fitting response to these.`
