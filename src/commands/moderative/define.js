	"propaganda": `\`\`\`Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to
	influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts
	selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using
	loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response
	to the information that is presented. Propaganda is often associated
	with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies,
	religious organizations and the media can also produce propaganda.\`\`\``,
	"gema": `Licensed audio and video material that falls under the European "Directive on
	Copyright in the Digital Single Market" (<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2019:130:TOC>)
	is subject to additional royalty fees. Responsibility for the implementation
	of this directive is imposed on the individual member states of the
	European Union. In the Federal Republic of Germany, this directive
	has been implemented as a collective of German laws, commonly referred
	to as "Urheberrecht" (roughly translates into "copyright law"). These laws constitutionally
	legitimize the German royalty fee collection agency "GEMA" ("Gesellschaft für
	musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte") and their subsidiaries.
	__This law however does only apply for public broadcasts.__`
